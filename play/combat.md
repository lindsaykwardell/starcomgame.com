# Combat Phase

## Initiate Combat

Combat takes place when two or more players have ships and/or stations in the same system. Actively engaging in combat (assigning and dealing damage) is not mandatory; you may decline to have your ships attack any other ships if you so choose. Combat is resolved one system at a time, with the order chosen by the active player.

## Assign Damage

The active player assigns all damage being dealt by ships they control. Not all ships must declare targets. Going clockwise, each other player involved in combat assigns all damage being dealt by ships they control.

## Apply Damage

Damage is resolved. All assigned damage is dealt to assigned targets.

## Retreat

Starting with the active player and going clockwise, any ships that have not moved may now move into another friendly or empty system. This is referred to as retreating.
   
Before each of these steps, starting with the active player and going clockwise, each player may play any commands or abilities they choose. Note that after a ship has assigned its combat damage, that damage will be dealt to the chosen target regardless of whether the ship was destroyed before the damage resolution step.
