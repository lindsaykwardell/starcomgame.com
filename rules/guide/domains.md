# Domains

Each card in the game (besides the core ships and stations) is part of a Domain. There are three domains - Industry, Statecraft, and Science. These domains reflect the focus of your nation. As you play, you will draw cards from the three domain decks to add to your hand. This will shape the way that you play.

## Industry

Industry is primarily focused on getting the most out of your resources. Industry cards provide additional combat options, as well as maintaining the size of your fleets. Industry also focuses on generating more credits.

## Statecraft

Statecraft focuses on defensive play, providing tools for building a strong support network for your systems. It relies on building defensive stations and fighters to secure its holdings. Statecraft cards also help manipulate the flow of the game in ways not related to combat.

## Science

Science is all about researching new technologies. Science cards typically will help defend your ships from attacks, or help you move your ships into position faster. Science is also good at drawing additional cards from the domain decks.
