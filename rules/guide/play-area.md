# Play Area

Shuffle the three Domain decks and the Systems deck, then lay out a grid of Systems (3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 grids are recommended). For each player, replace a corner system with a Homeworld starting system, then place a Scout ship adjacent to the Homeworld. Cards should face their owners when possible. Return the remainder of the Systems deck to the box.

Place the suffled Domain decks to the side, within reach of each player. Place all ship cards in piles of each type, face up, near the playing field. Space should be reserved in front of each player for any Technology cards they play.
