# Play Area

Directly in front of the player is the Technology Row, where researched technologies will go. In the center of the game area, place nine (or sixteen, or twenty-five) face-down System cards, placed into a diamond grid. Each player sits at one of the corners of this grid. Systems are considered adjacent on the diagonal lines of the grid only. Place the System deck and the three Domain decks to the side of the board.
