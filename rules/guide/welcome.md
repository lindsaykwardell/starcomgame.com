# Welcome to Star Commander

Star Commander (StarCom) is a card game of exploration, colonization, commerce, and conflict. In a single round of StarCom, you are fighting against other would-be empires vying for control of star systems, in order to grow your own influence across the galaxy.

## What do you need to play?

Everything you need comes with the game - three Domain decks of 30 cards each, one System deck of 25 cards, and a number of cards to represent different ships and stations. Credit tokens and development tokens are also included.

## How to Win

As the ruler of an interstellar nation, your goal is to expand your influence and defeat your opponents. The game ends when either a player's Homeworld is captured, or one of the Domain decks has run out of cards. Players then count their total developments. Whoever has the most developments wins!
