# Welcome to Star Commander

Star Commander (StarCom) is a card game of exploration, colonization, commerce, and conflict. In a single round of StarCom, you are fighting against other would-be empires vying for control of star systems, in order to grow your own influence across the galaxy.

## What do you need to play?

Everything you need comes with the game - three Domain decks of 30 cards each, one System deck of 25 cards, and a number of cards to represent different ships and stations. Credit tokens and development tokens are also included.

## How to Win

The goal of Star Commander is to dominate known space. To achieve that, you must conquer the homeworld of each opponent. When your homeworld is no longer under your control, you lose. When no other players remain, you win!
