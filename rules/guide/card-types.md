# Card Types

There are five card types in the game. Throughout play, you will be interacting with each of these at some point, so it's good to familiarize yourself with them.

## Ship

There are four ship types - Fighter, Small, Medium, and Large. Each has a cost, attack, and hit points. Some ships have other abilities written on them. Ships are the only cards that can move between systems. Ships are built at your Homeworld, and are placed on the side of the system card closest to you. Ships are placed on the board with their text facing their controller. All ships (but Fighters) can jump 1 system per turn, while Fighters cannot jump unless otherwise stated (if a card gives the ability to jump, or to jump an additional time, then fighters can perform that action).

## Station

Stations act just like ships, but cannot move between systems.

## System

Systems are the backbone of your empire. They provide resources to build ships and play other cards. The text of a System should be facing its controller. Systems also have a domain (see Domains).

## Technology

Technology cards allow for additional, long-lasting abilities. Technology cards are placed in the Technology row closest to the player.

## Command

Commands are cards that affect gameplay, then go to the discard pile. You play them from your hand onto the board, then move them to the discard pile.
