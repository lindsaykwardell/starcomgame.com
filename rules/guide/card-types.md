# Card Types

There are five card types in the game. Throughout play, you will be interacting with each of these at some point, so it's good to familiarize yourself with them.

## Ship

There are four ship types - Fighter, Small, Medium, and Large. Each has a cost, attack, hit points, and speed. Some ships have other abilities written on them. Ships are the only cards that can move between systems. Ships are built at your [Homeworld](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Homeworld) or in [Capital Systems](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Drummond), and are placed on the side of the system card closest to you. Ships are placed on the board with their text facing their controller. Ships can move (jump) between systems equal to their speed; a ship with a speed of 1 can jump to another system once per turn.

You can only control a number of ships equal to the total number of developments you control. If your number of developments is equal to or less than the number of ships you control, you cannot build more ships.

## Station

Stations act just like ships, but cannot move between systems. Stations can be built in any system you control. You may only build a number of stations equal to the number of developments in that system.

## System

Systems are the backbone of your empire. They provide resources to build ships and play other cards. Systems also have a domain (see Domains).

## Technology

Technology cards allow for additional, long-lasting abilities. Technology cards are placed in the Technology row closest to the player.

## Command

Commands are cards that affect gameplay, then go to the discard pile. You play them from your hand onto the board, then move them to the discard pile.
