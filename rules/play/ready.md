# Ready Phase 

*Do these in order.*

## Gain Credits

Gain credits as shown on your cards. Most resources come from Systems, but may also come from other cards you control. Gain 1 credit for each development you control in systems that are not under siege (see [Siege](/etc/additional-rules.html#siege)).

## Roll Domain Die

Roll the Domain Die (6-sided die). If the domain of a system you control is rolled, draw a card from the respective domain deck.

## Perform Start of Turn Actions

Perform any actions on cards you control that take place at the start of the turn.
