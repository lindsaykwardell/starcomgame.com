# Combat Phase

*Do these in order for each system*

## Initiate Combat

Look at which systems the active player and at least one other player has vessels. The active player then chooses the order that combat will be resolved in those systems.

## Assign Damage

The active player assigns all damage being dealt by ships they control. Not all ships must declare targets. Going clockwise, each other player involved in combat assigns all damage being dealt by ships they control.

## Resolve Damage

Damage is resolved. All assigned damage is dealt to assigned targets. If a ship or station has received more damage than its hit points, it is immediately destroyed.

## Retreat

Starting with the active player and going clockwise, any ships that have not used their full movement this turn may jump into another system that player controls.

## Playing Commands During Combat

After each of these steps, starting with the active player and going clockwise, each player may play any commands or abilities they choose. If a ship is destroyed before the Resolve Damage step, it does not deal damage.
