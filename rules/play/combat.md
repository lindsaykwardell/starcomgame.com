# Combat Phase

*Do these in order for each system*

Look at which systems the active player and at least one other player has vessels. The active player then chooses the order that combat will be resolved in those systems.

## Assign Damage

The active player assigns all damage being dealt by vessels they control. Players are not required to select targets for all valid vessels. Going clockwise, each other player involved in combat assigns all damage being dealt by vessels they control.

## Resolve Damage

Damage is resolved. All assigned damage is dealt to assigned targets. If a vessel has received damage equal to or greater than its hit points, it is immediately destroyed.

## Retreat

Starting with the active player and going clockwise, any ships that have not used their full movement this turn may jump into another system that player controls.

## Playing Commands During Combat

After each of these steps, starting with the active player and going clockwise, each player may play any commands or abilities they choose. If a ship is destroyed before the Resolve Damage step, it does not deal damage.
