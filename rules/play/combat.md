# Combat Phase

## Initiate Combat

Combat may take place when two or more players have ships and/or stations in the same system. Actively engaging in combat (assigning and dealing damage) is not mandatory; you may decline to have your ships attack any other ships if you so choose. Combat is resolved one system at a time, with the order chosen by the active player.

## Assign Damage

The active player assigns all damage being dealt by ships they control. Not all ships must declare targets. Going clockwise, each other player involved in combat assigns all damage being dealt by ships they control. Players have an opportunity to play Commands or use abilities before assigning damage.

## Resolve Damage

Damage is resolved. All assigned damage is dealt to assigned targets. If a ship or station has received more damage than its hit points, it is immediately destroyed.

## Retreat

Starting with the active player and going clockwise, any ships that have not moved this turn may now move into another system that player controls. This is referred to as retreating.
   
After each of these steps, starting with the active player and going clockwise, each player may play any commands or abilities they choose. If a ship is destroyed before the Assign Damage step, that damage is not applied.
