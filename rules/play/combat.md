# Combat Phase

## Initiate Combat

For each system where two or more players control vessels, each player, starting with the active player, decides whether to initiate combat. If each player declines, then combat is concluded in that system for the turn. If there are multiple systems where combat is possible, the active player chooses the order to resolve combat.

## Assign Damage

The active player assigns all damage being dealt by ships they control. Not all ships must declare targets. Going clockwise, each other player involved in combat assigns all damage being dealt by ships they control.

## Resolve Damage

Damage is resolved. All assigned damage is dealt to assigned targets. If a ship or station has received more damage than its hit points, it is immediately destroyed.

## Retreat

Starting with the active player and going clockwise, any ships that have not moved this turn may now move into another system that player controls. This is referred to as retreating.

## Playing Commands During Combat

After each of these steps, starting with the active player and going clockwise, each player may play any commands or abilities they choose. If a ship is destroyed before the Assign Damage step, it does not deal damage. However, if a ship is destroyed after the Assign Damage step and it assigned its damage, that damage will still be applied.
