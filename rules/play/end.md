# End Phase

## Conquest

For any system under siege (see [Siege](/etc/additional-rules.html#siege)), remove development counters from it equal to the number of non-Fighter ships the active player controls in that system. When the last development counter is removed, the active player has conquered the system, and places one development counter on the system.

## Cleanup

End of turn effects end. All ships with more damage than HP are destroyed. If any playerâ€™s [Homeworld](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Homeworld) has been captured, they lose. Remove all ships and counters they control from the board.
