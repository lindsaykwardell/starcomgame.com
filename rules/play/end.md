# End Phase

## Conquest

For any system under siege (see [Siege](/etc/additional-rules.html#siege)), remove development counters from it equal to the number of non-Fighter ships the non-controlling player controls in that system. When the last development counter is removed, the besieging player has conquered the system, and places one development counter on the system.

## Cleanup

End of turn effects end. If any playerâ€™s [Homeworld](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Homeworld) has been captured, they lose. Remove all ships and counters they control from the board.
