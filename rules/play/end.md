# End Phase

*Do these in order*

## Conquest

For any system under siege (see [Siege](/etc/additional-rules.html#siege)), remove development counters from it equal to the number of non-Fighter ships the non-controlling player controls in that system. When the last development counter is removed, the besieging player has conquered the system, and places one development counter on the system. Any stations that remain in the system change control to the player who now controls the system.

## Cleanup

End of turn effects end. If any playerâ€™s [Homeworld](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Homeworld) has been captured, they lose. Remove all ships and counters they control from the board.

## Game End

The game ends when either:

- A player's Homeworld has been conquered.
- The last card of a Domain deck has been drawn.
  
When one of the above conditions happens, the game immediately ends. Each player counts their total developments. The player with the most developments wins!
