# Command Phase

*Do these in any order*

## Move Ships

Ships that you have controlled since the start of your turn are able to move (or jump) to another adjacent system. Ships may only jump according to their speed. For example, a [Corvette](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Corvette) has a speed of 1, and so can only jump once per turn. A [Fighter](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Strike_Fighter) has a speed of 0, and so cannot jump.

Some cards (like [Enhanced Jump Drive](/card-database?selectedCard=Enhanced_Jump_Drive)) can increase a ship's speed, which allows for additional movement actions. The only time a Fighter can jump while having a speed of 0 is if a [Carrier](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Carrier) is in the same system as the Fighter and it jumps to another system.

## Explore

Whenever a ship enters a system with a face down System card, you must immediately flip it over. This is called Exploring. Some systems may have effects when they are explored, which are to be done before play continues and cannot be responded to.

## Build Ships/Stations

You may build any ships or stations that you can afford. Stations can be built in any system you control, while ships can only be constructed in starting systems and capital systems. There are some restrictions on when you can build ships or stations:

- You can only build a number of stations in a system equal to the number of development counters in that system. If a system only has one development counter, it can only have one station.
- You can only build a number of ships equal to the total number of developments you control.
- You cannot build a ship or station in a system that is under siege (see [Siege](/etc/additional-rules.html#siege)) or in a system where combat has taken place since your last turn, and opposing ships are still in the system. The exception is your starting system, where you can always build ships (but not stations).

## Develop Systems

You may build developments on systems. If you control a ship in an uncontrolled system, you may pay 1 credit to build a development. This gives you control of the system. You may build additional developments by paying the number of developments on the system plus 1. (In order to go from 1 development to 2, you must pay 2 credits).

Systems can only have a number of developments on them equal to their maximum development value in the top right corner of the card.


## Play Commands

You may play Commands by revealing the card and performing the action on the card. Other players may respond with their own abilities or Commands (see [Responses](/etc/additional-rules.html#responses)). Discard the card afterward.

## Trade

You may do any of the following:

- Pay 3 credits to draw a card. If you already have five cards in hand, you may not take this action.
- Discard two cards, then gain three credits.

You may also trade with players. These trades may include credits, cards in your hand or in play, and systems or vessels you control. If you trade a system to a player, remove all of your development counters and replace them with an equal number of that playerâ€™s development counters.
