# Objective

Star Commander is a competitive game where players are attempting to dominate a region of space. The objective of each player is to build the most developments in their systems before the end of the game. You can do this by building a strong defensive position, or by being aggressive and preventing your opponents from establishing their own empires.

At the end of the game, whichever player has the most developments wins!
