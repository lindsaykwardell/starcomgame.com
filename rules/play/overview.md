# How to Play

## Starting the Game

- Shuffle the domain decks and the system deck. 
- Place system cards face down on the board (3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 grid is recommended). Place a [Homeworld](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Homeworld) System in the starting system for each player, with a development token on it for that player.
- Each player is given 3 credits.
- Put a [Scout](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Scout) into play in each playerâ€™s starting system under their control.
- Choose who goes first, by some random method.
