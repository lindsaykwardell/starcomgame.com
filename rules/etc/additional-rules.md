# Additional Rules

## Drawing Cards

Whenever a card or an action directs you to draw a card, you may only draw from a deck that matches a domain you control. For example, if you play [Explore the Unknown](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Explore_the_Unknown), and you only control systems with a Science domain, then you must draw from the Science deck.

## Fighters

Fighters are small, single-occupant ships that are unable to jump or support themselves. Fighters are unable to participate in a siege (see [Siege](/etc/additional-rules.html#siege)). If a fighter is abandoned (only fighters remain in a system you do not control) at the start of your turn, and remains abandoned at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.

## Hand Limit

You may only have up to five cards in your hand at a time. If you attempt to draw a card with five cards already in your hand, you must either discard one first or skip your draw. At no time should you have more than five cards in hand.

## Responses

Whenever, during either the Command or Combat Phases, a player plays a card or uses an ability, it can be responded to. In each case, the active player chooses whether to use another card or ability, then each other player may choose, going clockwise from the active player. When all players pass, the sequence of cards and abilities is resolved. These actions are resolved in “last on, first off” order. 

## Siege

A system is considered under siege when an opponent has non-Fighter ships in that system, and the controlling player has no ships or stations with attack values. Systems that are under siege do not generate credits from developments, and players cannot build ships or stations in systems that are under siege. Effects of that system do not trigger and abilities cannot be used.

Note that for the purposes of drawing cards, a player may still choose the domain of a system under siege. 

## Turn Order

If there are more than two players in a game, players will take turns in a clockwise order. The same applies for performing any actions, such as playing Commands, taking turn actions, or activating abilities (see [Responses](/etc/additional-rules.html#responses)).

## Targeting

Ships and stations can only target in their current system. If an ability on a card says that a ship or station you control does something to another ship, this same rule applies. Any card that refers to “target ship or station” (or similar) may perform its action in any system.

## Vessels

Some cards refer to vessels. A vessel is either a ship or station.
