# Additional Rules

## Hand Limit

You may only have up to eight cards in your hand at a time. If you attempt to draw a card with eight cards already in your hand, you must discard one first. If an action puts a card into your hand, you must also first discard a card. At no time should you have more than eight cards in hand.

## Turn Order

If there are more than two players in a game, players will take turns in a clockwise order. The same applies for performing any actions, such as playing Commands or activating abilities (see [Responses](/etc/additional-rules.html#responses)).

## Targeting

Ships and stations can only target in their current system. If an ability on a card says that a ship or station you control does something to another ship, this same rule applies. Any card that refers to “target ship or station” (or similar) may perform its action in any system.

## Responses

Whenever, during either the Command or Combat Phases, a player plays a card or uses an ability, it can be responded to. In each case, the active player chooses whether to use another card or ability, then each other player may choose, going clockwise from the active player. When all players pass, the sequence of cards and abilities is resolved. These actions are resolved in “last on, first off” order. 

## Contested System

A contested system is a system which is controlled by a player where combat has occurred since their last turn. Ships and stations cannot be built in contested systems, and existing ships cannot be repaired or scrapped (unless otherwise stated).

## Siege

A system is considered under siege when an opponent has non-Fighter ships in that system, and the controlling player has no ships or stations with attack values. Systems that are under siege do not generate credits from developments, and players cannot build ships or stations in systems that are under siege.

## Fighters

Fighters are small, single-occupant ships that are unable to jump or support themselves. You may only control a number of fighters equal to your total development count. Fighters are unable to participate in a siege (see [Siege](/etc/additional-rules.html#siege)). Treat fighters as having a jump distance of 0. If a card says that a ship may perform a jump outside of its normal ability, that card applies to fighters as well (for example, [Jump Nexus](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Jump_Nexus) or [Enhanced Jump Drive](https://www.starcomgame.com/card-database?selectedCard=Enhanced_Jump_Drive)).
