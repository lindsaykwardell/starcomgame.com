# Additional Rules

## Drawing Cards

Whenever a card or an action directs you to draw a card, you may only draw from a deck that matches a domain you control.

## Fighters

Fighters are small, single-occupant ships, so there are some rule restrictions on what they can do.

- Fighters are unable to participate in a siege (see [Siege](/etc/additional-rules.html#siege)).
- Fighters cannot be used to build the first development in a system.
- Fighters start with a base speed of 0.

## Hand Limit

You may only have up to five cards in your hand at a time. If you attempt to draw a card with five cards already in your hand, you must skip your draw. At no time should you have more than five cards in hand.

## Responses

Whenever, during either the Command or Combat Phases, a player plays a card, uses an ability, or takes an action, it can be responded to. In each case, the active player chooses whether to use another card or ability, then each other player may choose, going clockwise from the active player. When all players pass, the sequence of cards and abilities is resolved. These actions are resolved in “last on, first off” order. 

## Siege

A system is considered under siege when an opponent has non-Fighter ships in that system, and the controlling player has no ships or stations with attack values. Systems that are under siege do not generate credits from developments, and players cannot build ships or stations in systems that are under siege. Effects of that system do not trigger and abilities cannot be used.

Note that for the purposes of drawing cards, a player may still choose the domain of a system under siege. 

## Turn Order

If there are more than two players in a game, players will take turns in a clockwise order. The same applies for performing any actions, such as playing Commands, taking turn actions, or activating abilities (see [Responses](/etc/additional-rules.html#responses)).

## Vessels

Some cards refer to vessels. A vessel is either a ship or station. A card referring to a vessel refers to both.
